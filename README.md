# robotic-arm

PyTorch deep learning framework for 3 layer neural network for arm angle classification.
Algorithm achieves 85% accuracy and is set up to train for 4000 epochs. 3 different sets of data
contained in data folders. Model weights in the model folder and results for figures in Results.
Test_segmentation contains a mediapipe framework for computer vision segmentation and vpp_nn
is the full pipeline for training and generating results

Our firmware code development is shown here, but the working code is private in GitLab: https://github.com/dcunhrya/IronManAlgorithm
